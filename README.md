# Noble Elements

A mod adding a brand new group of elements to the game Opus Magnum. As of now, this mod is a work-in-progress meant for gathering feedback on the concept. Anything and everything is subject to change, so don't count on any puzzles you make with this still working in future versions of the mod.

## Glyphs

The glyph of reactivity works by transmuting one atom of nobilis and one atom of either alpha, beta, or gamma into the other two. Place each atom on the symbol of the element you want to transmute into. The glyph will not work if all three hexes are occupied by atoms.

The glyph of coronation works like calcification, transmuting alpha, beta, or gamma into nobilis.
